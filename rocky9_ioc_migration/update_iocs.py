This script uses the modules_and_versions.json file to update the
/configure/RELEASE files in every IOC. Each RELEASE file has
environmental variables that are module names assigned to their
latest version. For example,

FFMPEGSERVER_MODULE_VERSION         = R2.1.1-2.2.2
HISTORY_MODULE_VERSION              = R2.7.0
IOCADMIN_MODULE_VERSION             = R3.1.16-1.4.0
